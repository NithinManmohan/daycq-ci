<div>
Allows build Steps to be performed before the SCM performs any modification to the workspace,
<BR/>Warnings:
<BR/>The SCM may modify or remove any files that are in the workspace, before the main build steps.
<BR/>Enviroment variables may not exist at this point, if they are created by other plugins, check using a shell script and the env (unix) or equivalent for your executor system.
<BR/>IMPORTANT: Failed build steps will not cause the job to fail at this point, and all build steps will be called regardless of the result.
